Blackjack rules:
  - Number cards are worth their number in points. Face cards are worth ten points. Ace can be eleven or one point, depending on what works best.
  - The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 points without going over.
  - You ask for a new card to be added to your hand by taking a "hit".
  - If you are happy with your hand, you can "stay".
  - You play against the house, who is also trying to get close to 21.
  - Going over 21 is a "bust". Bust hands cannot accept new cards.
  - Whoever is the closest to a score of 21 without busting is the winner.
